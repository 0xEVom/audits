## [H-01] Insufficient access control in `setRouter()` allows uncontrolled minting of `DcntEth`

### Lines of code

[DcntEth.sol#L20-L30](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DcntEth.sol#L20-L30)

### Impact
The `DcntEth` contract is designed to interface with the `DecentEthRouter` contract, which is intended to be the sole entity capable of calling the functions [`mint()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DcntEth.sol#L24) and [`burn()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DcntEth.sol#L28). These functions are critical as they directly affect the token supply of `DcntEth`. The [`setRouter(address _router)`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DcntEth.sol#L20) function is meant to establish the router's address, which is then enforced by the `onlyRouter` modifier on sensitive functions.

However, the current implementation of `setRouter()` lacks any form of access control, allowing any user to set themselves as the router. This poses a severe security risk as an unauthorized user could call `setRouter()` to set their address as the router and subsequently invoke `mint()` to arbitrarily increase the token supply in their favor, leading to potential token inflation and devaluation.

### Proof of Concept
1. An attacker deploys their own contract or uses an EOA.
2. The attacker calls `setRouter()` with their address.
3. The attacker is now set as the router and can call `mint()` to mint an arbitrary amount of `DcntEth` to any address they choose.

### Tools Used
Manual review

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
To mitigate this issue, implement access control in the `setRouter()` function. This can be achieved by adding the `onlyOwner` modifier.

The code fix would be as follows:

```solidity
function setRouter(address _router) public onlyOwner {
    router = _router;
}
```

This change ensures that only the owner of the contract can set or change the router, preventing unauthorized manipulation of the token supply.

### Impact
This issue is internally the same as described in https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca-findings/issues/1220. To avoid duplication of efforts and unnecessary copy-pasting, only the differences are explained in this issue.

### Proof of Concept
The entry point here is the [`bridgeWithPayload()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197) function in the `DecentEthRouter` contract, which allows the caller to pass a variable-length `additionalPayload` variable. This variable is then encoded as part of the `payload` variable returned by [`_getCallParams()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L80) and [passed](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L185) as parameter to `DcntEth.sendAndCall()`. This is a function that `DcntEth` inherits from `OFTV2`, which inherits it from [`BaseOFTV2`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/ca7d4f1d482df5e17f8aaf1b34d0e4432020bc4e/contracts/token/oft/v2/BaseOFTV2.sol#L25) . This function calls the internal [`_sendAndCall()`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/ca7d4f1d482df5e17f8aaf1b34d0e4432020bc4e/contracts/token/oft/v2/OFTCoreV2.sol#L152) function inherited from `OFTCoreV2`, which finally calls `_lzSend()`. This ties into the description of the vulnerability in the aforementioned issue.

On the other end, the message will be processed in the [`onOFTReceived()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L237) function of the same contract, which is invoked in the [`OFTCoreV2.callOnOFTReceived()`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/ca7d4f1d482df5e17f8aaf1b34d0e4432020bc4e/contracts/token/oft/v2/OFTCoreV2.sol#L48C14-L48C31) function when receiving a message. Our payload will be extracted as the [`callPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L251) variable and passed on to the executor, where the `msgType` is hardcoded as `MT_ETH_TRANSFER_WITH_PAYLOAD` in `bridgeWithPayload()`. Finally, in  `DecentBridgeExecutor`, we [always](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L77-L80) get a call to our target address with the payload we defined (of which only its size matters), in which we can drain as much gas as needed for the attack. This completes the exploit as all intermediary steps are explained in great detail in the issue referenced above.

### Tools Used
Manual review

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
The recommended mitigation is similar to the one in the reference issue. Alternatively or in addition to it, a maximum size for any variable-length parameters that can be passed in a LayerZero message to an arbitrary address could be implemented.

[DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L63](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L63)

### Impact
The `DecentBridgeExecutor` contract has two private functions, [`_executeWeth()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L24) and [`_executeEth()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L54), which are used to execute transactions with a custom payload received through the Decent bridge.

In both functions, if the call to the target contract fails, the contract sends the funds back to the `from` address. This behavior is problematic because the `from` address is hardcoded as `msg.sender` in the `_getCallParams()` function on the [sender side](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L148):
https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L100-L109
```solidity
	if (msgType == MT_ETH_TRANSFER) {
		payload = abi.encode(msgType, msg.sender, _toAddress, deliverEth);
	} else {
		payload = abi.encode(
			msgType,
			msg.sender,
			_toAddress,
			deliverEth,
			additionalPayload
		);
```

The problem is that the sender in the source chain may not be in control of the same address in the destination chain. For instance, this could occur if the sender is a Gnosis Safe created using the `createProxy()`Â function of the Proxy Factory. This issue has been exploited in the past to [steal 20 million $OP](https://inspexco.medium.com/how-20-million-op-was-stolen-from-the-multisig-wallet-not-yet-owned-by-wintermute-3f6c75db740a).

### Proof of Concept

1. Alice owns a Gnosis Safe deployed using the `createProxy()` function of the Gnosis Safe Proxy Factory. 
2. Alice initiates a cross-chain transaction from her safe through the [`DecentEthRouter.bridgeWithPayload()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197) function. The `_getCallParams()` function hardcodes the address of Alice's safe on the source chain as the `from` address.
3. The transaction is processed by either the `_executeWeth()` or `_executeEth()` function in the `DecentBridgeExecutor` contract of the target chain.
4. The transaction call to the target contract fails due to an issue outside of Alice's control, such as the target contract being paused.
5. The `DecentBridgeExecutor` contract sends the funds to the `from` address, which is the address of Alice's safe on the source chain.
6. However, since Alice does not control this address on the destination chain, she is unable to access these funds. This results in a loss of funds for Alice.

### Tools Used
Manual review

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to revert the transaction if the call to the target contract fails, instead of sending the funds to the `from` address. Since the `DcntEth` contract is a `NonblockingLzApp`, this is the recommended behavior as failed transactions are stored and can be retried after they fail.

## [H-04] Dropping payload in `onOFTReceived()` may lead to loss of funds

### Lines of code

[DecentEthRouter.sol#L266-L269](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L266-L269)

### Impact
The [`DecentEthRouter.onOFTReceived()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L237) function is responsible for handling incoming messages from the Decent bridge. It decodes the payload of the transfer to extract necessary information such as the type of message, sender, recipient, and whether the transfer should be in ETH or WETH.

If the message type is `MT_ETH_TRANSFER_WITH_PAYLOAD` and the sender sets `deliverEth` to false, the transaction is expected to allow the target contract to pull the WETH amount in a call with the given payload:
https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L31-L33
```solidity
	weth.approve(target, amount);
	(bool success, ) = target.call(callPayload);
```

However, if the WETH balance of the `DecentEthRouter` is lower than the transferred amount, the payload is simply dropped and instead, `DcntEth` is sent to the target address:
https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L266-L269
```solidity
	if (weth.balanceOf(address(this)) < _amount) {
		dcntEth.transfer(_to, _amount);
		return;
	}
```

This could lead to loss of funds as the user may have required the payload to be executed to obtain the funds.

### Proof of Concept

1. A user initiates a cross-chain transaction by submitting a message through the `DecentEthRouter.bridgeWithPayload()` function. They want to stake WETH on a contract on another chain by calling the function `stakeWETHFor(address account, uint256 amount)`.
2. The `DecentEthRouter` receives the message in `onOFTReceived()`.
3. Its WETH balance is less than the amount of WETH the user is transferring.
4. The payload is dropped and instead transfers `DcntEth` directly to the target contract.
6. The user's funds are locked as `DcntEth` in the contract and cannot be recovered.

### Tools Used
Manual review

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
 If the WETH balance is not sufficient when processing a message of type `MT_ETH_TRANSFER_WITH_PAYLOAD`, revert and allow the sender to retry the message later. Alternatively, ensure there is always enough WETH in all supported chains, or at the very least document this behavior.

> consider scope of blockchains to those supported by layerzero

The [`DecentEthRouter.onOFTReceived()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L237) function is responsible for handling incoming messages from the Decent bridge. It decodes the payload of the transfer to extract necessary information such as the type of message, sender, recipient, and whether the transfer should be in ETH or WETH.

The issue arises in the decoding of the payload. The function assumes that the address size is always 20 bytes. This is true for Ethereum-based chains, but not for all blockchains. For instance, Aptos uses [32-byte addresses](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/technical-reference/mainnet/supported-chain-ids#aptos). This discrepancy in address size can lead to incorrect decoding of the payload, potentially causing transfers to fail or be misdirected.

### Proof of Concept
1. User initiates a transfer from Aptos to an Ethereum-based chain using the bridge.
2. The `onOFTReceived()` function on the Ethereum side tries to decode the payload.
3. The function assumes a 20-byte address, but the payload contains a 32-byte Aptos address.
4. The decoding fails or produces incorrect results, leading to a failed or misdirected transfer.

### Tools Used
Manual review

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
The contract should not make assumptions about the size of addresses. Instead, it should dynamically determine the correct size based on the chain ID. This could be achieved by maintaining a mapping of chain IDs to address sizes, which can be updated as new chains are supported. The function would then use this mapping to correctly decode the payload. This would ensure compatibility with all supported chains, regardless of their address size.

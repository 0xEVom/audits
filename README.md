# EV_om's Portfolio

## About

I'm an independent security researcher specialized in smart contract audits.

Currently, I'm competing in audit contests and acting as a [Validator](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors/validators) on Code4rena, where I'm ranked #19 on the yearly [leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard).

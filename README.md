## About

I'm an independent security researcher specialized in Solidity, Cairo and Rust audits. My current areas of focus are VMs, cross-chain applications and ZK applications.

I initially developed my expertise through competitive audits on Code4rena, where I ranked #8 solo and #2 with [Radiant Labs](https://code4rena.com/@RadiantLabs) on the 2024 yearly [leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard?timeframe=2024). Nowadays, I (seldom) act as a judge on Code4rena and Cantina.

I work with multiple intermediaries to provide high-end audits at any stage of a project's lifecycle. If you wish to engage me as an auditor, feel free to reach out to any of the below providers to request me:
- [Spearbit/Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/solutions/spearbit)
- [Zenith](https://www.zenith.security/) (Code4rena)
- [Blackthorn](https://www.blackthorn.xyz/) (Sherlock)
- [Certora](https://www.certora.com/audits)

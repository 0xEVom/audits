## About EV_om

I'm an independent security researcher who specializes in smart contract audits. 

Currently, I'm competing in audit contests and acting as a [lookout](https://code4rena.com/how-it-works/lookouts) on Code4rena. I'm currently ranked #4 on the 90-day [leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard?timeframe=Last%2090%20days) on Code4rena and was the top performer in December and January.
